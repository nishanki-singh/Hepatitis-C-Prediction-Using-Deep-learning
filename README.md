# DeepHepa-C
DeepHepa-C is an AI-based application that predicts the likelihood of Hepatitis C infection based on user-provided data. The application features a user-friendly interface that enables patients to input their medical history, symptoms, and other relevant information. Using machine learning algorithms, DeepHepa-C then analyses the data and generates a report that provides patients with a detailed assessment of their Hepatitis C risk level.

DeepHepa-C is designed to be accurate, reliable, and easy to use. The application utilizes state-of-the-art AI models that have been trained on large datasets of patient information, enabling it to provide highly personalized predictions. The report generated by DeepHepa-C includes a breakdown of the patient's risk factors and provides actionable recommendations on how to mitigate the risk of Hepatitis C infection.

With DeepHepa-C, patients can gain a better understanding of their health status and take proactive steps to protect themselves from Hepatitis C. Whether you're a healthcare provider looking to improve patient outcomes or an individual concerned about your Hepatitis C risk, DeepHepa-C is the ideal solution for accurate and personalized risk assessment.
